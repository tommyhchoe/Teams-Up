##Description and Features of the app

###Description
Teams App, is an app that will create two balanced teams from a group of people. Say that you want to play a sport, and you have a group of people to create the two teams from, all you have to do is add the names of each person, and give them a star rating depending on their skill, and then the app will create two teams that are fairly balanced. 

###Features 

These are the features that we want to add to this app.

- Simple interface
- Able to add/delete players.
- Give players a rating of stars from 1 - 5 depending on individual skills, and also be able to modify the rating.
- Display the two teams created. 




###This project is open to anyone who wants to contribute.

Visual aspects of the app, can be modified.
